== About Me

First, I **LOVE** link:./%5BUniverse-of-Notes%2FDomain-of-Science%2FComputer-Science%2FComputers.html[Computers]](https://publish.obsidian.md/ryan-howell/Notes/My+Academics/Domain+of+Science/Computer+Science/[[Universe of Notes/Domain of Science/Computer Science/link:./Notes%2FComputers.html[Computers]|link:./Notes%2FComputers.html[Computers]]]), I love most things having to do with link:./Notes%2FComputers.html[computers], and that accounts +
for almost everything in here. 

I live in https://publish.obsidian.md/ryan-howell/California[California]

I'm very fortunate that I get to write software for a living

I'm an executive at a fictional company called the https://publish.obsidian.md/ryan-howell/Salsa+Group[Salsa Group]. +
The company "exists" for educational purposes and anyone is welcome to join. The original goal +
was to learn about technologies like https://publish.obsidian.md/ryan-howell/AWS[AWS], https://publish.obsidian.md/ryan-howell/JIRA[JIRA], https://publish.obsidian.md/ryan-howell/GitHub[GitHub], etc… basically anything that +
you would want to know to write software professionally, or with a team. I find that it's hard to +
learn about these things because we often learn how to use them in the absence of any +
meaningful context. So basically Salsa Group is a kind of simulator that aims to provide that +
context. However, there's nothing preventing it from being used and simultaneously creating +
something that one can be proud of. In that sense, it's meant to solicit for collaboration.
